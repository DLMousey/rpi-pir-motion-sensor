# rPI PRI Motion Sensor
A simple project that expands on the fantastic [guide](https://github.com/CamJam-EduKit/EduKit2/blob/master/CamJam%20Edukit%202%20-%20RPi.GPIO/CamJam%20EduKit%202%20-%20Sensors%20Worksheet%206%20(RPi.GPIO)%20-%20Alarm.pdf) from CamJam-EduKit.

The wiring is the same as in their guide, just with additional software features.
